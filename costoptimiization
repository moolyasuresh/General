1. Enable AWS Config recording for global resources only in one region: Because AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a global service, IAM users and roles are global entities. They are not tied to one AWS Region. Deploying controls (rules) to evaluate IAM in one AWS Region is sufficient to get the compliance state of IAM resources.
2. Use AWS Managed rules as they are maintained by AWS and you do not pay any additional AWS Lambda charges to run them.
3. Use CFN Guard to create the custom rules as there is no need to create a lambda function .
4. Make sure that there are no duplicate rules.
5. Ensure judicious usage of “DeleteResults” and “Re-evaluate”rules functionalities for your config rules to avoid spike in AWS Config billing: AWS Config stores compliance state changes of resources as evaluated by AWS Config Rules. The annotation for this resource type is “AWS::Config::ResourceCompliance”. Whenever you  “Delete results” (DeleteEvaluationResults API) and “Re-evaluate” a config rule (StartConfigRulesEvaluation API) for a rule there will be a new CI created for this resource type to record the latest compliance state. This could impact your AWS Config CI recording costs if these actions are called on a frequent basis.
6. Identify resources that are undergoing the most configuration changes on a routine basis to control costs: Since AWS Config tracks changes to the configuration of resources, resources that are undergoing a lot of mutations may end up incurring higher than normal Config recording charges. Use CloudWatch Metric to get the amount of CI being generated by resource type.
7. Deprecate indirect relationships(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/faq.html). : This feature is not GA yet but can be done for Itau by submitting a ticket through AWS Account team.
